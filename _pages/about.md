Data scientist with a strong foundation in electronic engineering and a focus on machine learning research. I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electronic Engineering, complemented by hands-on experience through internships in development engineering and software development. During my internships, I gained valuable insights into IoT and contributed to an open-source machine learning Python repository.

My master's focused in machine learning and advanced signal processing, with my research in the application of deep learning to fiber optic sensors (FBG and DAS). I possess a solid understanding of deep learning, classical machine learning and computer vision techniques, further bolstered by my interest in neuroscience.

Adept not only in fundamental data science tools like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch (also in Tensorflow but I rather use Pytorch) but also skilled in PySpark and SQL, I leverage these tools to preprocess and analyze complex datasets and build predictive or clasification models. With experience in data visualization using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I am adept at presenting insights in a clear and compelling manner.

Driven by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge, I consistently seek opportunities to expand my skills and stay updated with the latest advancements in the field. With a strong analytical mindset, attention to detail, and an obsesive minset for solving complex problems.

I am now eager to apply my research abilities and practical experience to contribute to meaningfull projects as a data scientist!
