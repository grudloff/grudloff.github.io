Iâ€™m Gabriel, a Machine Learning Engineer with a solid foundation in electronic engineering. During my masterâ€™s degree, I explored the fascinating intersection of machine learning and fiber optic sensors, developing innovative approaches to unconventional challenges. My journey has taken me from designing embedded systems to implementing cutting-edge AI solutions and supporting enterprise clients on Google Cloudâ€™s services.

ðŸ”§ What I Bring to the Table

- GCP Specialist: I provide expert, hands-on support for services like Vertex AI, BigQuery, Dataflow, and more, ensuring reliable and efficient solutions for enterprise architectures.
- Machine Learning Engineer: From deploying scalable pipelines in Kubeflow to bringing novel AI research ideas to life, I excel in crafting data-driven solutions.
- Software Engineering: With Python as my go-to tool, Iâ€™ve contributed to open-source projects and developed software across a wide spectrum, from embedded systems to cloud applications.

ðŸ’¡ How I Got Here

My career began in software development in Chile, where I worked on impactful projects close to my field of study. My passion for AI then led me to a research center in France, where I had the privilege of contributing to the implementation of novel machine learning algorithms. For my masterâ€™s thesis, I developed an innovative solution in a unique and unconventional domain.

Throughout my journey, I realized I lacked hands-on experience with cloud providersâ€”a gap I was determined to fill. This decision led me to my current role, where Iâ€™ve become a GCP expert, blending my skills in machine learning, engineering, and cloud computing to make a tangible impact.

ðŸŒŸ What Drives Me

Curiosity has always been my guiding principle. Itâ€™s driven me to explore, learn, and tackle new challenges throughout my career. I thrive in environments that value curiosity, encourage innovation, and foster continuous growth.

ðŸ‘€ Letâ€™s Connect!

Iâ€™m always eager to collaborate, learn, and take on new opportunities in data science, machine learning, or cloud solutions. If youâ€™re seeking a problem-solver with a passion for technology, letâ€™s connect and explore how we can work together.


If you're wondering about the photo in the header, I captured it in stunning Carretera Austral near Villa Oâ€™Higgins, Chile. The magnificent tree is a Ã‘ire (Nothofagus Antarctica), standing at the edge of a lake.
