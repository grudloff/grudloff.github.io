Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in electronic engineering, with specialization in computer science, telecommunications, and signal processing. I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electronic Engineering. My master's focused on machine learning and advanced signal processing, with my research in applying deep learning to fiber optic sensors (FBG and DAS). Consequently, I possess a solid understanding of deep learning, classical machine learning, and computer vision techniques. Moreover, thanks to my academic background I grasp a bottom-up understanding of computer science from the bare electronics to application-level abstractions.

Adept not only in fundamental data science tools like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow but also skilled in PySpark and SQL, I leverage these tools to preprocess and analyze complex datasets and build regression or classification models. With experience in data visualization using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I am adept at presenting insights clearly and compellingly.

My current job is related to the Big Data services from Google Cloud Platform which has allowed me to gain a broad understanding of the application and usage of cloud services in the context of AI & ML. Thus, I gained hands-on knowledge of services related to the ETL/ELT process, such as Cloud Storage (Data Lake), BigQuery (Data Warehouse), Dataflow (Beam), and Dataproc (Spark) as well as tools related to Data Science and ML Engineering, mainly in the services that fall under the Vertex AI umbrella, providing the necessary tools for experimentation (Workbench notebooks), experiment tracking (ML metadata), productionizing (Custom training, Model Registry, Model Evaluation, etc) and the deployment of inference and training pipelines (Vertex AI Pipelines and Cloud Composer).

In short, I have the knowledge and experience to perform every step of the data journey, from preprocessing, analyzing, developing ML solutions, and bringing this solution to production with modern MLops best practices.

Driven by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge, I consistently seek opportunities to expand my skills and stay updated with the latest advancements in the field. With a strong analytical mindset, attention to detail, and an obsessive mindset for solving complex problems.

I am eager to apply all the knowledge I have acquired in applications with significant impact!

If you are curious about the picture in the header, I took it in beautiful Chile's Carretera Austral near Villa O'Higgins. The majestic specimen is a Coihue (Nothofagus Betuloides) growing at the edge of a lake.
